I used Amazon Review dataset for sentiment analysis task from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bittlingmayer/amazonreviews).
"__label1__" corresponds to 1-and 2-star reviews and "__label__2" correspondes to 4- and 5- star reviews, and they are classes "0" and "1" respectively in my dataframe.
(I uploaded my version of preprocessed dataset in dataframe on kaggle: [url](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shinnew9918/amazonreviews-df)) <br>
Since the server/GPU does not work well in a kaggle environment, ( I used GPU P 100), and the running time was 224 hrs, the PC was paused after 8 hrs of running. <br>
If I have enough GPU resource, I will definitely run it. The code has saved for the case.
