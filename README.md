I used Amazon Review dataset for sentiment analysis task from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bittlingmayer/amazonreviews).
"__label1__" corresponds to 1-and 2-star reviews and "__label__2" correspondes to 4- and 5- star reviews, and theyt are classes "0" and "1" respectively in my dataframe.
(I will upload my version of preprocessed dataset on kaggle: url) 
Since the server/GPU does not work well in a kaggle environment, ( I used GPU P 100), and the running time was 224 hrs, the PC was paused after 8 hrs of running. 
If I have enough GPU resource, I will definitely run it. The code ahs saved for the case.
